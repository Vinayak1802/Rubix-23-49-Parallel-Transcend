    <h3>Our Journey</h3>
    <p>This whole idea of launching a startup happened when we recognised the problem in current society. what harm is the social media platform like instagram, facebook and tiktok bringing to our youth. Just think about it.will this platform 
        still be used by individuals if there is no option of who likes whose photo, who follows whom on social media platform.Not just social media platform but also OTT platform like netflix , amazon prime , and etc.
    people are so hooked to these platform that they dont give time to building their own skills. when asked in an interview to reed hastings(the CEO of netflix) which OTT platform do you consider your biggest rival, to which he replied "Sleep is our biggest competition" and in this they are somewhat successful.
 seeing this problem we launched our company 'soothify' in pandemic, raising 20 Million in series A round.we Started with 4 members but today as of 2023 we are a team of 30 employees and we continue to grow on </p>
